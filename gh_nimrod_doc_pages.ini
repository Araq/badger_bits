["gh-pages"]

# The update_html parameter is only for gh-pages, it specifies the
# file that will be updated with the list of generated documentation.
# This parameter can't be empty.
update_html=index.html

# The doc_dir parameter is only for gh-pages, it specifies the path
# to the directory where generated documents will be placed. This
# parameter can't be empty.
doc_dir=gh_docs

# The ignore_tags parameter is only for gh-pages, it specifies the
# names of the tags that won't be processed. By default all available
# tags are processed. Use a triple quote multiline comment to specify
# one tag per line. You can use empty lines to separate tags visually.
#
# Since tags usually represent static snapshots of a git tree, if
# a tag has already been generated gh_nimrod_doc_pages will ignore
# it during a following run.

# The branches parameter is only for gh-pages, it specifies the
# names of the branches that will be processed. By default no branches
# are processed.

# Branches specified here will be deleted and regenerated every

# The link_html parameter can be used everywhere, it specifies the
# paths to the files you want to be linked from the HTML index. This
# can be useful if you have a complex library with several modules
# and you only want one of the files to be indexed, either because
# its imports lead to the others, or because you consider that to be
# the public API. Same with generated rst files.
#
# If this parameter is empty all generated HTML files will be linked.
